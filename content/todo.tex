\section{Extracting HOG based on PASCAL bounding boxes}

\section{steps nn}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item extract hog for all bicycle and car training images with bounding box
	\item cluster features with 3000 kmeans cluster
	\item extract hog for all bicycle test images with bounding box
	\item generate codebook for each window in each image \ref{codebook_calculation_alg}
	\item calculate euclidean distance between codebooks
	\item iterate over all test images and print with N nearest images
\end{enumerate}
	
\section{steps nn-iter}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item extract hog for all bicycle and car training images with bounding box
	\item cluster features with 3000 kmeans cluster
	\item extract hog for all bicycle test images with bounding box
	\item generate codebook for each window in each image \ref{codebook_calculation_alg}
	\item calculate euclidean distance between codebooks
	\item iterate over all test images and print with N nearest images\label{nn_iter_loop_start}
	\item remove codebook entries if not shared by other N images
	\item restart with \ref{nn_iter_loop_start} till no changes
\end{enumerate}

\section{steps svm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item extract hog for all bicycle training images with sliding window
	\item randomly discard 55\% of windows per image to fit into memory
	\item cluster features with 3000 kmeans cluster
	\item extract hog for all bicycle training images with bounding boxes as positives
	\item extract hog for all bicycle training images except bounding boxes as negatives
	\item assign features by nearest neighbor to clusters to generate codebook \ref{codebook_calculation_alg}
	\item train exemplar svm for each positive
	\item extract hog for all bicycle test images with sliding window
	\item generate codebook for each window in each image
	\item assign label for each window with each trained svm
\end{enumerate}

\begin{eqnarray}
codebook_k : \text{element at position }k\text{ in codebook} \\
f_i : \text{feature }i\text{ of window or image} \\
C_k : \text{cluster }k \\
d_{ik} : \text{distance of feature }i\text{ to cluster }k \\
a_{ik} : \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }f_i\text{ belongs to }C_k \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \\
codebook_k = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{a_{ik}}{d_{ik}}
