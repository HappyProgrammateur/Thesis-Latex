\subsection{\acf{SVM}}
\label{sec:svm}

\acfp{SVM} were initially proposed by Wladimir Wapnik and Aleksei Tscherwonenkis in 1974 \cite{vapnik1974theory}. They showed a method for classification and linear regression which becomes one of the most popular algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence \cite{russellnorvig-ai}. A \ac{SVM} is typically a binary classifier which separates multiple datapoints into two classes. A supervised \ac{SVM} training is done by placing a line (for 2-D dimensional data) or a hyperplane between two different classes by maximizing the margin between all datapoints.
