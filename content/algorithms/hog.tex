\section{\acf{HOG}}
\label{sec:hog}

%\acs{HOG} were first introduced by Dalal and Triggs in 2005 \cite{Dalal2005}. Extracting \acs{HOG} from images consist of computing the gradients of pixel cells, grouped in blocks (the actual descriptors). The authors evaluated the usage of gamma/color normalization, but got only modest effects on performance. Gray scaling the images even reduces the performance.
%
%The first step for extracting \ac{HOG} from images is therefore the computation of gradients. It was evaluated that simple 1-D $[-1, 0, 1]$ masks with a $\sigma = 0$ smoothing scale produces the best results. Color channels are computed separately and the one with the largest norm is used as the pixel's gradient vector.
%
%The second step handles the binning by creating the cell histograms. In this step, each pixel within a $8 \times 8$ cell does a weighted vote for a histogram channel based on his gradient orientation. The weight of the vote is calculated by the magnitude of the gradient.
%
%As the gradient strengths vary over a wide range, based on illumination variations and foreground-background contrast, a local contrast normalization is required as a third step. This is done by grouping the histogram cells into larger blocks. The authors evaluated two grouping approaches, rectangular HOG (\acs{R-HOG}) and circular HOG (\acs{C-HOG}). \acs{R-HOG} are typical organized as $3\times3$ or $5\times5$ cell blocks. \acs{C-HOG} are grouped by a log-polar grid. According to the authors, at least two radial bins and four angular bins (makes a total of five to eight bins, depending if the center is also divided) are needed for good performance.
%For the normalization multiple approaches produced the same performance:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item L2-Hys $v \rightarrow \frac{\max(v / \sqrt{||v||_2^2 + \epsilon^2}, 0.2)}{\sqrt{||\max(v / \sqrt{||v||_2^2 + \epsilon^2}, 0.2)||_2^2 + \epsilon^2}}$ %TODO renormalizing
%	\item L2-norm $v \rightarrow v / \sqrt{||v||_2^2 + \epsilon^2}$
%\end{itemize}
%The L1-sqrt ($v \rightarrow \sqrt{v / ||v||_1 + \epsilon}$) reduced the performance by 5\%, whilst omitting the normalization reduced it by 27\% according to \cite{Dalal2005}.
