\chapter{Work}
\label{cha:work}

This chapter describes the experiments and approaches implemented and evaluated during this thesis. It should give a description about the decisions made and the problems occurred based on the decisions and implementation limitations.

All experiments were done by using the bicycle class of the \ac{VOC2011} Image database \cite{Pascal2011} with images from other classes as negative samples. The basic experiments also included the car class to get an overview if the tested approaches could be used as a similarity measure.
