One of the central fields in computer vision is the search in image databases. It is researched since multiple decades and many algorithms exists which become faster and more precise on every new development. During this thesis different approaches were tested to optimize the search of image parts in such databases. One of the central techniques is to perform a higher amount of precomputation to reduce the online search effort. As the ExemplarSVM framework \cite{Malisiewicz2011} is currently widely used, it was used as a reference in terms of speed and search performance. The thesis shows that the applied approaches have the potential to speed up the search, but also also still require additional adjustments to perform comparable to other algorithms.
